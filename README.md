#  Welcome to My MERN Stack Job Portal

## Info

A **MERN stack Job Portal** built for **Students** and **Companies** to interact through job listings and internship opportunities.

---

##  Features

This project includes a dynamic, role-based user interface where:

-  **Students** can browse job/internship openings, apply for opportunities, and track their applications.  
-  **Companies** can post job openings with deadlines and view participant registrations, including resume downloads.  
-  **Admins** have extended API access. While not actively used in the current app, admin routes exist for role and permission management.  
-  A **profile page** is available for users who want to personalize their account.  
-  **Permission-based access** ensures users can only access routes relevant to them.  
  - Students: apply, view their applications, view/edit their profile.  
  - Companies: post jobs, view applications/resumes for their opportunities.  
-  A **Superadmin** exists who can create and assign roles, and perform all admin-level operations.  

> Forgot your password? Use the **"Forgot Password"** feature â€” you'll receive an email with a token link to reset the password then **remember it!**
